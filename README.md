##Freatures
- Once the bot is on your Discord server, you can type "tune.on" to syntonize with one of the stations. The time of the video is synchronized with the real time world, so any music can be playing when you turn on the radio.
- Once you listened to all the musics, the radio will automatically loop the source video, starting the musics all over again and being loyal to the game.
- If you only want a low background music, you can change the volume by typing "tune.volume N", N being a value between 0 and 100.
- You can also mute the radio station if you need a minute of silence typing "tune.mute".
- To turn off the radio and remove the bot from the channel, type "tune.off".
